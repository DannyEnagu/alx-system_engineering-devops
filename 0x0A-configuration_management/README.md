# 0x0A. Configuration management
 In a nutshell, server configuration management (also popularly referred to as IT Automation) is a solution for turning your infrastructure administration into a codebase, describing all processes necessary for deploying a server in a set of provisioning scripts that can be versioned and easily reused. It can greatly improve the integrity of any server infrastructure over time.

This project walked us through the process of automating server provisioning using Puppet, a popular configuration management tool capable of managing complex infrastructure in a transparent way, using a master server to orchestrate the configuration of the nodes. our focus was on the language terminology, syntax and features necessary for creating a simplified example of how puppet resources and manifest.
